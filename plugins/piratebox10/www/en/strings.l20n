                <p>Now, first of all, there is nothing illegal or scary going on 
                here. This is a social place where you can chat and share files 
                with people around you, <strong>anonymously</strong>! This is an 
                off-line network, specially designed and developed for 
                file-sharing and chat services. Staying off the grid is a 
                precaution to maintain your full anonymity. Please have fun, 
                chat with people, and feel free to share any files you may like.</p>
